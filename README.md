# About Workout Tracker

Workout Tracker is  a simple web application that allows authenticated users to create, read, update and delete workouts.

I, as a junior full-stack developer, created this app to demonstrate my skills and provide a simple, intuitive solution for individuals looking to track their workouts.

## Technology Stack - (MERN)
Workout Tracker is built using the MERN stack, which consists of the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing the workout data.
- Express: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

## Features
- Authentication: Only authenticated users can access the app, ensuring that only you can view your workout data.
- Create Workouts: Easily create new workouts and add exercises to them, with the option to specify the name, sets, reps, and weight for each exercise.
- View Workouts: View a list of all your workouts, including the date and time they were created, and view the details of each workout by clicking on it.
- Update Workouts: Easily update your workouts, whether it's to add more exercises or modify the details of existing ones.
- Delete Workouts: Delete workouts that you no longer need, keeping your workout history organized and clutter-free.
